# erfindergarden-sideboard
This is the sideboard we built in erfindegarden. 

It is build so Euroboxes fit in it. 

We are at the moment letting every new member of erindergarden design a handle for the boxes as its quite difficult to get the heavy boxes out. 

I finally managed to model it in fusion and made a version with taps i want to laser cut and also mill soon.
